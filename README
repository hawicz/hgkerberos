Overview
--------

hgkerberos provides support for kerberos authentication
(Negotiate/SPNEGO) over HTTP.

hgkerberos has been successfully tested against Apache's mod_auth_kerb.


Configuration
-------------

Install pykerberos. In debian, the package is
python-kerberos. pykerberos is developed by Apple so it should be
available somewhere for Mac OS X. I don't believe it is available for
Windows.

Install urllib2_kerberos: easy_install urllib2_kerberos

Configure your .hgrc to enable the extension by adding following lines:

[extensions]
hgext.kerberos=
# or, if kerberos.py is not in the hgext dir:
# kerberos=/path/to/hgkerberos.py
